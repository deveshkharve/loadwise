#### üìå Usage

1. Upload a Load Document

- Upload a freight invoice or load-related document.
- The system will extract the load number using OCR + AI, along with a confidence score.
- If the detection is incorrect, manually update the load number before proceeding.

2. Verify & Fetch Bill Details

- After confirming the correct load number, click `Get Load Bill Details`
- The system logs into TriumphPay and retrieves the bill details associated with the load.

3. View Data

- Once retrieved, data is displayed in a tabular format.
- If no data is found or the process fails, you may revise the load number and retry.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. Character Confusion in OCR

- OCR may misread visually similar characters (e.g., O vs 0, S vs 5, I vs 1), leading to incorrect load number extraction.

2. Scraping Limitations

- Currently only supports TriumphPay.
- Expanding to support other providers would require additional automation or agent-based approaches (e.g., headless browser + workflow agent), but this could increase cost.
